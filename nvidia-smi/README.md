### Implement the `watch` command in Windows similar to Linux

#### Usage:

1.  Save the **`watch.py`** file anywhere.
2.  Ensure the python interpreter you use has the necessary packages, especially **PyQt5** and **pyinstaller**.
3.  Go to the same directory as the **`watch.py`** file in cmd or PowerShell under administrator privileges, then type the command **`pyinstaller -D .\watch.py`**
4.  The **`.exe`** file in output folder is all you need.
